graph TD
    A[WhatsApp Web API] --> B[Connection Handler]
    B --> C[Message Router]
    C --> D[Command Handler]
    C --> E[AFK Handler]
    D --> F[Birthday Service]
    F --> G[Database]
    E --> G
```

### Core Components

- Connection Handler: Manages WhatsApp Web connection using Baileys
- Message Router: Routes messages to appropriate handlers
- Command Handler: Processes user commands
- Birthday Service: Manages birthday-related operations
- Database: SQLite storage for birthdays and bot state

## Command Reference

| Command | Format | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Add Birthday | `@smartbot addBD.Name,DD/MM/YYYY,+PhoneNumber` | Add a new birthday |
| Remove Birthday | `@smartbot removeBD.+PhoneNumber` | Remove a birthday |
| List Birthdays | `@smartbot listBD` | Show all birthdays |
| Enable AFK | `@smartbot AFK` | Enable away mode |
| Disable AFK | `@smartbot AFKOFF` | Disable away mode |
| Status | `@smartbot status` | Show bot statistics |
| Bulk Import | Send CSV file with caption `@smartbot importBD` | Import multiple birthdays from CSV |

### Bulk Birthday Import

You can import multiple birthdays at once using a CSV file. Your Excel/CSV file should look like this:

| Name           | Birthday   | PhoneNumber  |
|---------------|------------|--------------|
| John Doe      | 25/12/1990 | +1234567890  |
| Jane Smith    | 01/01/1995 | +9876543210  |
| Alice Johnson | 15/03/1988 | +1122334455  |

Save this as a CSV file (e.g., `birthdays.csv`).

**CSV Requirements:**
- First row must be the header: `Name,Birthday,PhoneNumber`
- Birthday format: `DD/MM/YYYY`
- Phone numbers must include country code with `+` prefix
- No spaces in the CSV format (except in names)

To import:
1. Create your CSV file following the format above
2. Send the CSV file to the bot
3. Add caption: `@smartbot importBD`

The bot will process the file and add all birthdays, skipping any duplicates or invalid entries.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# AI Configuration (Optional)
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Database Configuration
DB_PATH=./database/birthday.db

# Bot Configuration
BOT_PREFIX=@smartbot

# Owner Configuration (Required for AFK)
OWNER_NUMBER=911234567890  # Your number without +
```

### Why OWNER_NUMBER?

The `OWNER_NUMBER` is required for the AFK system to:
1. Restrict AFK commands to the bot owner only
2. Auto-disable AFK when the owner sends messages
3. Send AFK notifications to the correct chat
